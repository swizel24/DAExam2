Step 1. Open Git Bash in that particular folder. Type git init (this will make that folder a repository)
Step 2: Type git add . (this will add all files to the repository)
Step 3. Type git commit -m “Initial commit msg” (all files now in the repository)
Step 4. Type git status (you will get a msg, “On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean” this shows your local repository is finally created)


These are the steps that are used to make a local repository, now to push the same to a GitHub repository we use the following steps-
Step 1. Open your GitHub profile and create a New Repository. Copy the SSH Key of that created repository.
Step 2. Open Git Bash in that particular folder that you want to push. Type git remote add origin PASTE_SSH_KEY_OF_CREATED_REPO. Then type git push origin master –force (type ‘main’ in place of the ‘master’ if your default branch is master). Please refer to the following picture (if needed):
Now, refresh your Github page, you will be able to see your committed folders/files there.
